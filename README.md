**# CrunchChewSlurpProject

Final year project by Darshan Singh (dsing002) at Goldsmiths University of London**

Food allergy sufferers face major problems when eating out, As a result, this mobile phone application called Crunch Chew Slurp has been developed to tackle the problem with a lack of ingredients listed and inappropriate food labelling. The system works by allowing users to scan food products barcodes and reveal a full list of ingredients. With an allergy input form so the scanner can consider pre-existing allergies (although this is only experimental and currently does not work) and alert the consumer. While a forum/chat function will allow users to connect with likeminded allergy sufferers to help ease social anxiety, but currently only has placeholder code due to a lack of development time available for the final MVP that was made.

Further functionality incluides register/login capabilities by connecting to Firebase. An edit profile page where users can input allergies, hobbies and upload a new profile photo. The settings page shows options that would be available to users if the app were to be published and openly accessible.

This project was built using react native and expo CLI, with the open food facts database for packaged food items ingredients. Firebase was used to store user credentials. This app has been built by myself only, with the use of code that has been modified from:
- https://github.com/expo-community/expo-firebase-starter for the login and register formats
- https://github.com/OmarATARI/EasyScan code was used to get my scanner working with the database after multiple attempts to do so failed
